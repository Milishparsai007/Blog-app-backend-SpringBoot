This is a backend service for a blog app.
In this project I have used Spring Boot for creating RESTful APIs.
It also has JWT Authentication which allows token based authentication for a user.
The workflow is also represented in a flowchart in a separate file.
All the layers of Microservice - Controller,Service,Database,Repository are included an represented as separate unit.
It is fully functional with accepting all CRUD operations.
